                    Mental health significantly impacts overall health, with mental illnesses leading to severe impairment and a reduced quality of life. Ubiquitous computing technologies are emerging as crucial tools for collecting behavioral, physiological, social, and environmental data to enable early symptom detection, deliver preventative interventions, and support ongoing symptom management. However, designing, implementing, and validating these technologies in mental healthcare is complex and faces multiple challenges, including ensuring clinical relevance, integration into existing care systems, user engagement, ethical considerations, and long-term feasibility. </p>

                    <p class="text-black-faded text-left">
                    The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers, clinicians, practitioners, and industry professionals with both technical and clinical expertise to address the abovementioned challenges by exploring novel technologies, analytic methodologies, and design approaches that advance the development and implementation of ubiquitous computing systems for mental health. Past UbiComp Workshops on Mental Health and Well-being have successfully convened a multidisciplinary community to engage with these topics (more information on previous workshops is available <a href="/past-workshops.html">here</a>). Building on the insights gathered from prior years, this year’s workshop has refined and broadened its focus and scope.

                </ul>

            <p>All submitted papers will be reviewed and judged on originality, technical correctness, relevance, and quality of presentation. We explicitly invite submissions of papers that describe preliminary results or work-in-progress, including early translational experiences. The accepted papers will appear in the UbiComp supplemental proceedings and in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work in person and receive feedback from attendees. We plan to have a fully in-person workshop in Espoo, Finland.
